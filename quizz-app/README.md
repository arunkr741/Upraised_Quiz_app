This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

install the required packages
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```
 run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

this project is using an open mock server API, which has only 50 request limit.
So for showing the demo, I have to regularly change it's subdomain to make it work, so feel free to reachout to me for that



Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
